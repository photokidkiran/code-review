You take off your shoes and throw it to divert the zombies, you get a head start but they are on to you. Time to RUN!! .

you find the library to be empty, you check the place where # usually sits and you find him unconcious on the floor . 
You had seen Professor Neil's car in the parking lot while running and you remember that Professor keeps his spare car keys in his desk draw in the Pavillion building .
What will you do next? .
1. You go alone to get the car   2. Can't risk leaving any one behind, you carry # along with you .
