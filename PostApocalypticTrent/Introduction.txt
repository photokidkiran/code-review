You wake up with a head ache, looking around, you are in your Software Engineering Lab .
No one is around, you look at your watch and the time is 21:27 Hrs. You are not able to recollect why you were there for so long .
So, you look outside the window looking at a guy running out of Mary Ann Evans, you shout to him .
$ : Hey!! where is everybody? .
Guy: Run for your life! Run!! .
Suddenly a group of weirdly walking people catch hold of him and start to feed on him, then you realize that they are zombies, The Guy points at you and the whole zombie group start running towards Mary Ann Evans to get you. You start running to get out of the building, while you getting out you feel your phone vibrating .
You check your phone and find a message from # . 
“ # :Hey, the college has been attacked by zombies and I’m stuck at the library. Tried calling you. Call me ASAP.” .
Before you could make a call the phone switches off due to low battery. You go down till the exit and there are zombies right outside the gate. What would you do? .
1.	Confront the zombies   2. Create a diversion and run towards the library .
